everybody Welcome to see a 349 user interfaces my name is Jeff Avery I'm the instructor for the scores for the term very happy to be speaking to you remotely as it were so this is the first lecture for the for the term once upon a little bit of time talking about and give you an introduction if this was the first class this is what it would do any ways to try to give you a rundown of what the courses of votes for the position of course in your minds and obviously
designer started thinking about what's good and what's bad about set of a design elements all right so
people are concerned right in front of their essential for a lot of things that we do the focus for most users isn't on the device it's on the task and wants to perform and what most people are concerned with is how well does this device this computer support what I needed to do for me
so trust this is a sort of process of continually providing input to the machine to the computer and the Machine processing that input doing something with it and giving us feedback and then we can get more feedback
actually Building Systems to support this interaction these two things go back and forth these two concepts her to work together
Shipley the first commercially successful graphical user interface that was sold it sold in the market I'm tired of this but they were in opcs running IBM or Microsoft or they were
fairly common ways of interacting with the the computers
talk a little bit about haptics these are all touch base interfaces primarily then includes things like walls haptic interfaces instead of large-scale touch systems will talk about those
you got something is very effective so industries that have sort of emerged because of the fact that we design software very task-oriented software for people that makes them are helps to be very effective
with honour to design rooster is squarely in the middle of sort of you know heavy design and ux on this side and sort of back-end development on this side this course Turtle sits in the middle in the Brockton doing things like pulling in data from a back-end to sort of have users interact with a design from other disciplines effective design so
alright so pedagogy this is really the syllabus everything over to talk to you about now is actually I'm up the course website as well I'm going to breakfast at the beginning she can find all this information I'm just going to try to summarize a little bit of it there's some design but it's light you know there's not a lot of design topics recover but there's a handful Electric
lectures delivered by a video the way we're doing right now these will all be recorded and made available at beginning of the week okay the idea is that I'm going to start I'm certainly going to keep Pace with what we would normally have is a schedule if this was in person and Tennis to record those lectures by topic and all right these will be posted online they're not done live because I understand that many people are going to be in a different country different so I want them to be available for you to download
given a right to ask questions online and get some help her notes slides plus sample code will all be available on the course website
Ava is because Travis sort of the primary language for Android development and I think mobile small device Computing is super important right now so it's a it's sort of a good tool set for us to work with okay with your friends and software called us and we will we will lose a lot of marks and getting a lot of trouble if you copy of Silence
what is here here's pictures of the Corps staff assessments and Grading is everything we've already talked about it's listed here one thing I didn't mention his text books there are no textbooks so they should be sufficient for you if you decide you need more material there's a resources tab that has a lot of resources you are not expected to read any of this but if you're interested in any of the topics need help sort of figuring out how to do stuff this is a good place to start
these topics are a little loose I was from them up before the terms actually underway and like I said code sample shirts instructions for Serta setting up your environment and we have a lot of food samples that I've created sitting and get you can actually do a clone of that repo pull the samples down and you should be able to compile and kill them all is well so lots of information right
turn off people seeing you but you sign up with your real name at least the courts that can get in touch with you
