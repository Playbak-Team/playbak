## Description

Playbak is a tool in progress, built with <a href="https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate">Electron React Boilerplate</a>, that provides an all in one platform for completing online work.

Currently, Playbak is equipt with two main features

<ol>
<li> PBS Video</li>
<li> Kanban Board </li>
</ol>

PBS (Playback Speed) is our way of automating the playback speed of lecture videos by increasing speed over moments of relative silence (such as breaks by the instructor or moments of writing) and automatically return to regular speed once talking resumes.

The open source for the generation is at this <a href="https://github.com/Playbak-Team/pbsgen">repo</a>.

## Future Plans

We plan on adding more features that with the goal of reducing the number of tedious things a student has to endure throughout a school term.

This ranges from automating due dates of assignments, giving approriate reminders, note extraction, etc.

If you have any suggestions feel free to leave any!
